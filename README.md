Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a person, who has explored various fields of IT over the past decade, with a focus on programming for the last 5 years. In 2020, I achieved the finalist position in the Technical Innovation Olympiad. My experience has led me to take roles of an architect or team lead in university projects.

Technologies I work with:
